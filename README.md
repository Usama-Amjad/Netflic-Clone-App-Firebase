# Overview
Welcome to our Netflix clone website, a comprehensive platform for movie enthusiasts to manage their viewing preferences and explore a vast library of films. Users can effortlessly sign up by providing their email, password, and name, and log in with their credentials. Upon successful login, users are directed to the home page, which showcases four curated categories of movies: top-rated, most-watched, horror, and entertaining movies. These categories are dynamically populated via an API, ensuring an up-to-date and diverse selection. Users can click on any movie to access its dedicated page, where they can watch trailers and view details such as the release date, title, and genre. The home page also features an account option, allowing users to manage their favorite movies. By marking a movie as a favorite, it gets saved to the user's account page, providing a personalized movie experience. This seamless integration of account management, movie browsing, and favoriting guarantees an engaging and user-friendly interface.
